echo "We want to remove the directory MyDirectory as well as all its content"
echo "1) try to remove the directory using the command 'rm'
 -- you should have encountered an error as 'rm' cannot directly remove a directory --
2) find the manual of the command rm (using the man command or by finding its online version)
3) find the option necessary to remove a directory (tip: recursive)
4) remove the directory using 'rm' with the correct option
3) execute 'verify_lvl8.sh' to unlock next level"
